\section{Preamble}
The project was written in Kotlin over Java for multiple reasons, namely the null-safety that Kotlin offers as it is easy to produce NullPointerExceptions in Java, whereas Kotlin allows for null values to be ignored and not used. Lambdas, listeners and anonymous classes are also much less verbose and thus makes code more legible compared to Java. \\

It does however use Java for the ContentProvider and SQLiteDatabase, as the author is more versed with these types of classes in Java from coursework material and coursework material.\\

The application itself allows for the importing of GPX (albeit very verbose) data, tracking of running and annotating each trip through ratings and comments on milestones throughout the run.

\section{Terminology}
\subsection{Trip} 
A \textit{Trip} refers to a run; as the user could use this for running/walking/journeys, we decided to name it trip. It is a dataclass found as Trip.kt. It holds the following: \\

\begin{tabular}{lcl}
\textbf{id} & - & The ID of the Trip \\ 
\textbf{name} & - & Name of the Trip\\ 
\textbf{notes} & - & \begin{tabular}{@{}l@{}}Contains JSON data for various settings of a trip, such as rating, comments \\ on trackpoints, etc. This is used so additional functionality could be added later.\end{tabular}\\ 
\end{tabular} 
\newline

\subsection{Trackpoint}
Trackpoint refers to the data-class Trackpoint.kt, which stores data on a point during the run, such as:  \\

\begin{tabular}{lcl}
\textbf{tID} & - & Trip ID it is associated with \\ 
\textbf{seq} & - & Sequence number of the point in the run \\ 
\textbf{lat/lng} & - & Latitude / longitude coordinate of the point\\ 
\textbf{elev*} & - & Unused; elevation at the point. \\ 
\textbf{time} & - & Seconds since the Unix epoch \\ 
\end{tabular} 
\newline

\textit{* unused due to permissions needed from Google for Elevations API. Can however be gathered through importing GPX data.}


\subsection{Movement}
This is an array of \textbf{Trackpoints}, which is held by a \textbf{Trip} object. This makes it easy to get the first and last of a Trips trackpoints, for estimating journey length, distance and starting / end dates.


\newpage
\section{Activities navigation}

Runt contains the following activities: \\

\textbf{IntroActivity}\\
This is where we prompt the user of what the apps purpose is, and whether they accept to our permissions that we need; storage access and location. \\

\textbf{MainActivity} \\
This acts as the main menu, where users can decide whether they want to start a new run, view their previous trips or exit the app. \\

\textbf{ListTripsActivity} \\
This displays the users each trip with data such as how far they ran and in how long. It will initially contain one test trip, but is where the users can find and import GPX data (the Import button on the map).\\

\textbf{ViewTripActivity} \\
This is where the user can view their trip in detail; it shows the route they took through Google Maps, the rating they chose for the trip and comments made on each of the milestones in the run. Clicking on a milestone will highlight it on the map. \\

\textbf{TrackActivity} \\
This is where the user starts and stops their run, they can view where they are and been on the map, with updates to how fast they are running, how long for and how far.\\

You can view the Navigation diagram in the Appendix.

\section{TrackActivity and TrackService}

Two of the main components in the application would be how the application tracks the user during their run, and updates the activity to show this.  \\
The way these two work together are as follows: \\

The user starts the activity. At this point, we start and bind to the service, but \textbf{don't} start tracking the user yet. It is at this point we receive the IBinder object to the service.\\ 

Then when the user presses start, we invoke the startTracking() function on the service, which will create a LocationListener that will register location updates and - whilst we're bounded - add Trackpoints to our \textbf{activities} trackpoint buffer. This allows the map to be updated for each location update, so the user can see where they've been and where they are. \\

Once the user navigates away from the activity, in the case that they put it into their pocket or check another app, we unbind from the service and move the service to the foreground (since Android Q, we need to keep a persistent notification for foreground). Each location update from here will be added to the services own Trackpoint buffer. \\ 

Once the user comes back to the application, we will bind back to the activity. This removes the service from the foreground, as we do not need it whilst they are using our app. \\
When this happens, the BOUNDED variable will be updated in the service and once we receive our binder, we retrieve the services buffer (which is then cleared) and we add each new Trackpoint to the activities buffer aswell as the map. \\


\section{Database}

The database contains two tables: Trip and Movement.

The Trip table contains the ID of the trip, the Name of the trip and Notes, a column that uses JSON for miscellaneous data about the trip, such as ratings and comments. We decided to use this format instead of an explicit ratings column and comments column because it is more extensible. \\
In the case that a feature was to be added, such as a description of the trip, we can add this to the Trip model class by including getting a 'description' key from JSON and writing it to the JSON. 

We can then implement a TextView for the description in the relevant activity and link it to the Trip variable. This is in contrast to an approach where we would add a description column to the table. In this case, after updating the table, we would have to write more code for the ContentProvider to retrieve this data, linking this to the activity and so forth.


The Movement table contains Trackpoint data, with a foreign key of the above Trip ID (tID). This table resembles a GPX trkpt, the only difference being the inclusion of a seq column to keep track of the order packets should be in. This mainly came about due to a mis-reading of the coursework specification, whereby the author thought GPX files must be able to be imported.

\newpage


\section{Google Maps integration}
When it came to the RunningTracker, there was no better way to show the user their journey and visualize annotation better than implementing a Map view. \\

The initial idea was to create an Intent to open Google Maps on the users phone, however this would be cumbersome especially when attempting to look at a certain point and write or view a comment.\\


Another problem with this approach is that if Google Maps was not installed or disabled on the users phone, the action would fail or be opened in the browser. Instead, with an integrated fragment approach, the only requirement is that the user has Google Play Services installed, which most, if not all (apart from newly-rooted) devices will have.\\
